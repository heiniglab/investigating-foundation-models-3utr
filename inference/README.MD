Codes to get reference allele probabilities with DNABERT, Nucleotide Transformer, and PhyloP model

For PhyloP probability equals the conservation score

The inference is always performed on the forward strand. For the negative strand, the probabilities are then reverse complemented to match the mRNA content.
