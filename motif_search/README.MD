recognition of RBP binding motifs

* [eCLIP](eCLIP/) : get overlaps between eCLIP peaks and 3'UTRs
* [mobility](mobility/) : compute mobility for all 5-mers in the test set
* [split_data.ipynb](split_data.ipynb) : split 3'UTRs into train and test sequences. Mobility analysis is performed on test sequences only
