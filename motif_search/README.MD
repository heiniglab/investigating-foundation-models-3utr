Recognition of RBP binding motifs

* [eCLIP](eCLIP/) : get overlaps between eCLIP peaks and 3'UTRs
* [mobility](mobility/) : compute mobility for all 5-mers in the test set
* [split_data.ipynb](split_data.ipynb) : split 3'UTRs into train (75%) and test (25%) sequences. Mobility analysis is performed on test sequences only
* [plot_odds.ipynb](plot_odds.ipynb) : plot the mobility distribution and odds ratios for different mobility groups
